## What is it?

Cowboy Copy is a fork of Copy Host which copies the hostname from the address bar in Chrome. It does fine, but leaves "www" which is THE PITS for web hosting professionals. So, Cowboy Copy copies the bare URL- no www- to the clipboard. 

## Installation

Grab the SRC directory, turn on Developer mode in Chrome and install it. Google is your friend.

### Keyboard Shortcut

```Alt + C``` can be used to copy the hostname to your clipboard directly.
